@inproceedings{BBHR19,
	Abstract = {One of the approaches to constructing zero knowledge (ZK) arguments relies on ``PCP techniques'' that date back to influential works from the early 1990's [Babai et al., Arora et al. 1991-2]. These techniques require only minimal cryptographic assumptions, namely, the existence of a family of collision-resistant hash functions [Kilian, STOC 1992], and achieve two remarkable properties: (i) all messages generated by the verifier are public random coins, and (ii) total verification time is merely poly-logarithmic in the time needed to na{\"\i}vely execute the computation being verified [Babai et al., STOC 1991].},

Such a system is non-interactive and publicly-verifiable if, after a trusted party publishes a proving key and a verification key, anyone can use the proving key to generate non-interactive proofs for adaptively-chosen NP statements, and proofs can be verified by anyone by using the verification key.},
